To select a difficulty, use the mouse on the options,
or press the '1' or '2' key to select that difficulty.

To move the paddle back and forth, use the 'a' and 'd' keys or
move the mouse side to side while in the window.

To reset the game, use the 'r' key. Resetting the game will reposition
the paddle and ball, and reset the score.

To exit, either click on the red X in the top right of the screen,
or press the 'z' key.

You may notice the paddle is repositioned throughout the game, sometimes
there is an error which would crash the game and make you lose your score.
Repositioning the paddle prevents this fatal crash from happening and saves
your progress.

Moving the window while in-game may mess up the mouse controls.
