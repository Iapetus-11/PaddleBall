To select a difficulty, use the mouse on the options,
or press the '1' or '2' key to select that difficulty.

To move the paddle back and forth, use the 'a' and 'd' keys or
move the mouse side to side while in the window.

To reset the game, use the 'r' key. Resetting the game will reposition
the paddle and ball, and reset the score.

To go back to the main menu, use the 'm' key. This will reset the score
and allow you to change the difficulty.

To exit, either click on the red X in the top right of the screen,
or press the 'z' key.

You may notice the paddle is repositioned throughout the game, sometimes
there is an error in which the paddle overrides the ball or the ball
overrides the paddle. Resetting the paddle and ball to their initial values
fixes this bug.

Note: the mouse cursor will be trapped in the screen if you attempt to move
it out the left and right sides of the window. Moving it out of the window
via the top or bottom will free the mouse.
