## TODO:

* add help page on menu
* add obstacles / make it more like breakout

## HOW TO PLAY:
* To select a difficulty, use the mouse on the options,
or press the '1' or '2' key to select that difficulty.

* To move the paddle back and forth, use the 'a' and 'd' keys or
move the mouse side to side while in the window.

* To reset the game, use the 'r' key. Resetting the game will reposition
the paddle and ball, and reset the score.

* To exit, either click on the red X in the top right of the screen,
or press the 'z' key.

* YThe paddle may be repositioned throughout the game, sometimes the paddle overrides the ball so the position of
the ball and paddle are reset when this happens to prevent errors.

* Moving the window while in-game may mess up the mouse controls.
