# PaddleBall
PaddleBall is a game by Olim One Studios written in Java.
* The game is text based.
* Has mouse and keyboard controls.
* Uses JFrame and JTextArea.
* All 'graphics' are done via string manipulation.

## TODO:
* go back to menu button or key
* add help page on menu
* add obstacles / make it more like breakout
* add more hidden feautures

## HOW TO PLAY:
* To select a difficulty, use the mouse on the options,
or press the '1' or '2' key to select that difficulty.

* To move the paddle back and forth, use the 'a' and 'd' keys or
move the mouse side to side while in the window.

* To reset the game, use the 'r' key. Resetting the game will reposition
the paddle and ball, and reset the score.

* To go back to the main menu, use the 'm' key. This will reset the score
and allow you to change the difficulty.

* To exit, either click on the red X in the top right of the screen,
or press the 'z' key.

* You may notice the paddle is repositioned throughout the game, sometimes
there is an error in which the paddle overrides the ball or the ball
overrides the paddle. Resetting the paddle and ball to their initial values
fixes this bug.

* To free the cursor, move it out via the top or bottom of the window. The cursor will be sent back to the middle of the window on
an attempt to move it out of frame via the left or right sides.
